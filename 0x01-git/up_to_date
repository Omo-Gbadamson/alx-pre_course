I am using the vi text editor to implement my code writing

These are the command lines that was used:
* git add . => Instrumental in helping to add up all the files that we made changes on
* git commit -m <message> => Helps to stage the implemented changes in our code base
* git push => Helps to push our code from our local code base to a remote arena
* git branch => Helps check how many branches we have running on our repository
* git checkout => Helps to create a new branch where we can push our isolated works into
